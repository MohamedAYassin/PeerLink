## üöÄ Initial Setup

To get started, you need to configure your own ICE servers in `src/app.tsx`. Without this setup, the app will only work locally.

## ü§î Why Use PeerLink?

1.  **Cost-Effective**:  
    PeerLink avoids server-side storage, making it incredibly affordable. All files are shared directly between peers, eliminating the need for expensive cloud storage solutions.
    
2.  **Secure by Design**:  
    Since files are transferred directly (peer-to-peer) without being stored on any server, your data remains private and secure.
    
3.  **Fast Transfers**:  
    WebRTC ensures minimal latency, enabling swift file sharing even for large files.
    
4.  **Easy to Set Up**:  
    With clear instructions and minimal configuration, you can have PeerLink up and running in minutes.
